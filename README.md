Environment In One Place!
=========================

The [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/bagrat/dotfiles) contains full configuration of bash, vim and tmux that makes
up my full development environment in a single terminal tab.

## Installation

You may install the dotfiles on your own environment either automatically or
manually depending on what you rather prefer.

### Single Command

For a quick start, you can run this single command to get the environment set
up:

```
$ bash <(curl -s http://sh.bagrat.io/web.sh)
```

This will clone the repo and install all the required files onto your
environment.

### Manual Installation

If you are the kind that does not trust every single script, you are good too.
You can just clone the repo and use whatever files you like. If you wish to use
all of them, you can manually run the `install.sh` script which is shipped with
the repo.
